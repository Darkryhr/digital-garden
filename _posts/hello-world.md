So...I suppose an introduction is in order...Problem is find it really difficult for me to write about myself, But here goes nothing:
My name is Gabriel, and I guess I could call myself a developer / designer, well student at the very least.

**TL;DR**
This is basically a place for me to put myself out there, write down some of thoughts and maybe build up a sense of 'commitment/achievement/merit'.
I spend a lot of time thinking, not about anything much in particular but I hope that by putting pen to paper...or I guess, pixels to screen maybe(ðŸ¤·) I can improve and build on some of these B i g  T H i n K s, or at the very least get them out of my head and keep'em out.

**A bit of context:**
I'm relatively new to web development, I've only just recently concluded a course/bootcamp and have been continuously learning ever since. On one hand I really enjoy learning, and love the sheer quantity of tech and tools there are to absorb, on the other hand it's kind of mess out here, it's to lose track, lose focus and get spun into tutorial hell, or just generally feel down on yourself for not being as accomplished as you'd hope you'd be.

With the design it's a bit different, I've been "into it" for a while now, and even think I have a knack for it, but struggled to really up my level to the point where I felt my work was in any way, shape or form worthy of financial compensation, i.e. I didn't think I was good enough to get paid(still struggle to believe otherwise), but as with the development stuff, I hope this site and effort is the first step in rectifying that.

All other stuff comes and goes, and this place is where it should all go, whether it's a book i've just finished reading(or listening to), workout & gym stuff, writing and drawing, or just general philosophical/existential thoughts, I hope this will be a good space to store them all.

**P.S.**
If by some sheer coincidence somebody actually finds this, and then by even sheerer coincidence cares in some way, I hope to implements more stuff in the future, at the very least a contact form, for starters, then maybe email subscriptions, comments etc.

So I suppose an introduction is in order...thing is I find it kinda difficult for me to write about myself, But here goes nothing:
My name is Gabriel, and I'm a developer / designer.

## The Gist

This is basically a place for me to put myself out there, write down some of thoughts and maybe build up a sense of 'commitment / achievement / merit'.
I spend a lot of time thinking, not about anything much in particular but I hope that by putting pen to paper...or I guess, pixels to screen maybe(ü§∑) I can improve and build on some of these B i g T H i n K s, or at the very least get them out of my head and keep'em out.

## Some context

I'm relatively new to web development, but not to coding as a whole. I've recently concluded a course and have been continuously learning ever since. On one hand I really enjoy learning, and love the sheer quantity of tech and tools there are to absorb, on the other hand it's kind of mess out here, it's easy to lose track, lose focus and get spun into tutorial hell, or just generally feel down on yourself for not being as accomplished as you'd hope you'd be.

With design it's a bit different, I've been "into it" for a while now, and I even think I have a knack for it, but struggled to really level myself up to the point where I felt my work was truly professional grade, but as with the development stuff, I hope this site and effort will help work on that.

All other stuff comes and goes, and this place is where it should all go, whether it's a book i've just finished reading(or listening to), workout & gym stuff, writing and drawing, or just general philosophical/existential thoughts, I hope this will be a good space to store them all.

## To conclude

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by! I hope you'll check out some of my stuff, and if you have any input, problems, suggestions or even just wanna say hi feel free to send a mail my way.

## P.S.

If by some sheer coincidence somebody actually finds this, and then by even sheerer coincidence cares in some way, I hope to implement more stuff in the future, at the very least a contact form for starters(update: did thatüëç), then maybe comments etc.
